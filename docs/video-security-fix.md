# Video Security Fix Documentation

## Background

The application previously had a security issue with the video storage system. Videos were being served through public URLs, which meant anyone who discovered the URL pattern could potentially access paid video content without authorization.

## Compatibility Notes

This security fix includes measures to ensure backward compatibility and a smooth transition:

1. **Automatic Bucket Creation**: The system will automatically create storage buckets if they don't exist.
2. **Path Standardization**: Existing video paths in the database will be corrected to use a consistent format.
3. **Fallback Mechanism**: During the transition, if a signed URL can't be generated (due to "Object not found" errors), the system will temporarily fall back to using public URLs to ensure uninterrupted service.

## Changes Implemented

The following changes have been implemented to address the security issues while maintaining the user experience:

### 1. API Changes

- Updated `get-video-url/route.ts` to use signed URLs with a 12-hour expiration instead of public URLs.
- Created a new API endpoint `secure-video-bucket/route.ts` that:
  - Sets the videos bucket to non-public
  - Removes any existing public access policies
  - Creates proper RLS policies to ensure only authorized users can access videos

### 2. Supabase Storage Configuration

- Added a migration file (`20250426000000_fix_video_bucket_security.sql`) to:
  - Set the videos bucket to non-public
  - Remove any public access policies
  - Create proper RLS policies:
    - Allow authenticated users to upload videos
    - Allow instructors to access videos they've uploaded
    - Allow users to access videos they've purchased
    - Allow everyone to access free videos (price = 0)

### 3. Client-Side Changes

- Updated `video-utils.ts` to:
  - Use 12-hour expiration for signed URLs (matching the API)
  - Add fallback mechanisms to use the API when direct signed URL creation fails
  - Handle permissions errors gracefully
  - Maintain the same caching behavior to prevent excessive API calls

- Added an admin interface component (`secure-storage.tsx`) to:
  - Allow administrators to easily apply the security fixes
  - Show results of the operation
  - Export SQL migration scripts for future deployments

## Impact on User Experience

These changes maintain the same user experience while improving security:

- **Authorized users** continue to have seamless access to content they're entitled to view.
- **Video playback** works the same way, with the only difference being that URLs now expire after 12 hours.
- **Upload process** remains unchanged.
- **Caching mechanisms** still prevent excessive API calls and ensure smooth playback.

## How It Works

1. When a user attempts to play a video:
   - The `VideoPlayer` component requests a URL from the API
   - The API verifies the user's permissions (instructor, purchaser, or free content)
   - If authorized, a signed URL with 12-hour expiration is generated
   - The video plays normally with this URL

2. If a URL expires during playback:
   - The error handler in `VideoPlayer` automatically requests a new URL
   - This happens in the background without user interruption
   - The video continues playing with the new URL

3. The RLS policies enforce access control at the database level:
   - Only video owners (instructors) can view their own videos
   - Only users who purchased content can view paid videos
   - Everyone can view free videos

## Applying the Fix

Administrators can apply the fix through:

1. The admin interface at `/admin/setup`
2. Running the SQL migration file

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix is working correctly:

1. Upload a new video as an instructor
2. Attempt to access the video as a non-purchaser (should fail)
3. Purchase the video and verify access works
4. Create a free video and verify anyone can access it
5. Verify that instructors can always access their own videos

## Security Notes

- The 12-hour expiration for signed URLs provides a balance between security and user experience
- If a user shares a signed URL, it will only work for 12 hours
- The RLS policies provide a defense-in-depth approach by enforcing access control at the database level
- This approach is more secure than relying solely on obscurity or client-side checks
